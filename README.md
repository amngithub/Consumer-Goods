# Consumer-Goods
Consumer goods data is always in motion. Static reports get stale quickly, and most business intelligence tools are too inflexible to analyze on the fly. Tableau gets you out of the reporting dungeon so you can focus on timely, insightful analysis. With the ability to visualize in real time, you can avoid out of stocks, track on-shelf availability, evaluate marketing effectiveness, and dig into key performance indicators within and across retailers. You can even connect to live data and set up alerts to help you discover tomorrow's solutions, before they're problems. When it’s time to communicate, rich visualizations get your point across to leadership, partners, and investors—while interactivity enables them to draw their own conclusions. And you can present current findings, without telling the same old jokes about "out of season" data.
